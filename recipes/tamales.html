    <img src="/img/tamales.jpg" alt="shrimp alfredo" height="310" width="310" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tamales are very popular in hispanic cultures. They are known to be either
      spicy or sweet but mainly spicy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are stuffed inside of a corn husk or a banana leaf. The flour is made
      by mixing it with delicous ingredients and then filled with either meat,
      or cheese and jalapenos.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 lbs of tamale mix masa</li>
      <li>1 lb of chicken breast</li>
      <li>1/2 lb of serrano peppers</li>
      <li>2 yellow onions</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>5 bay leaves</li>
      <li>2 sticks of celery</li>
      <li>1 lb of green tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 lb bucket of lard</li>
      <li>1 bushel of cilantro</li>
      <li>Corn Husks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It's prefered to leave over night but you can do it for 3 hours,
        seperate the corn husks in the sink or a large container filled with
        water and let them soak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the chicken breast in water with one garlic clove, 2 sticks of
        celery, half an onion, and the 5 bay leaves with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the serrano peppers with one and a half onion, the green tomatoes,
        one garlic clove and add salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once chicken is ready you are going to shred the breasts into strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the peppers and green tomatoes are soft, blend them into the
        blender with the cilantro garlic cloves and the onions and add salt to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>Cook the green salsa and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Heat lard up almost to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        With the water you boiled the chicken you are going to start mixing the
        tamale mix with hot lard and salt until the mix is soft, yet firm enough
        to hold the chicken inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now remove the corn husks out of the water and let dry for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin filling the corn husks with the tamale mix - the flour or masa,
        and the green salsa and the chicken, then wrap the tamale and place it
        in the pot with water on the bottom. The pot has to have something to
        hold the tamales above the water so the steam will cook them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have all the tamales wrapped and in the pot, begin to put the
        pot on medium for 4 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
